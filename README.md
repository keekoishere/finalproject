# reCommander

A website that uses the Spotify API (spotipy library) to improve the interactivity between music listeners - send music recommendations through a website that allows you to track what your friends have listened to, giving you imediate feedback on your own recommendations so you can have an idea whether people have liked what you sent them or not. You can also keep track of every song or album that people have told you to listen to, conveniently showcased in an interactive table on your homepage.
